And those projects, they will come from time to time. And our expectation is that they're going to have reasonable pay backs, attractive pay backs, in many cases. And we'll just keep doing that when we see the opportunities. We think that's good for the platform, it's good for the Company and clients. On the Insights side, the Insights in developing markets, as I mentioned, both for the year and the quarter, were up well over 20%. In the developed markets, the total year ended up at 11%, the fourth quarter was in the mid single digit range.Again, that is a reflection of the fourth quarter '09 was just a bang out for the Insights business in the developed world.I would say that right now our clients are trying to navigate growth opportunities and now inflation concerns.

Literally, Q1, for us, was, against a comparative in Q1 of last year, where everyone was rebounding out of recession, and the new product launches -- the sales forecasting work that we do, via the bases product, was up in the plus 30%. And so, that thing was running hard, and this comparison didn't surprise us, because we knew it -- we knew that had to settle down. With respect to inflation, no doubt about it, that is the conversation amongst the CPG world. As I think you know, for us, that just spells opportunity, because the insight works we do is what allows them to develop strategy, ultimately, the execution of their pricing plans in the marketplace.

For the last 18 months, we have steadily tried to go longer on the development of the rural parts of these geographies, China, India, and, of course, broadly across Africa. To go longer -- and longer, for us, means building the footprint that delivers the metrics, creates the trends ahead of our clients' willingness to pay us. So we're going long. We're trying to develop the trends and all the insights, so that three years from now, they're willing to pay us, at the going rate, to do this. We have been bearing that burden now, for roughly, a year, and, as I said, we started this almost 18 months ago. And as -- when I use the term, fully invested, it reflects that -- the notion that we're trying to get three years ahead in these very important markets. The underlying growth really -- doesn't really depend on that, because I don't expect it to foster more for us, except in the second, third year, if you start today.

I think, needless to say, all the content interests are looking for three screen measure, simply to broaden the audience and get more, of course, advertising revenue associated with it. I will say the use of a three screen metric is still very, very, very small -- almost undetectable. I think some of the -- there are certain clients, ESBN, who, I think, are getting really good at how to use three screen metrics. There's no single metric they rely on, and they've got great research folks, and they use it to their advantage. I would call the three -- the use of three screen metric -- I'd call it nascent, at the best, but it really does offer a lot of advantage, going forward, and, as you know, we're very focused on providing a broad set of metrics that allows them to do this well. So, I don't think you'll see big revenue moves, in the measurement world, from any of the players on this subject in the near-term, but I think, in the long-term, it becomes very important for us -- for all of us and will provide for long-term double digit growth.",Dave Calhoun,NIELSEN HOLDINGS PLC,2011,Dave Calhoun,100873,G6518L108,2011,4,2,2011Q2,30-Jun-11,2011,2,12,INDL,C,D,STD,NLSN,NIELSEN HOLDINGS PLC,USD,2011Q2,Y,1-Aug-11,14870,11,1492633,I,Matched (3),1
