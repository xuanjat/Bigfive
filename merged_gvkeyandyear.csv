0,122519,2010,"Thank you. Clearly we are focused on improving gross margin. Clearly we're focused on keeping our operating expenses flat even as we expect, working toward achieving growth again. If we're successful at expanding our gross margins, if we're successful at creating new growth this year and next, then you would -- then you would certainly see an improvement in our operating margins. We are predicting that, but that clearly would be the consequence. Well, I think we made -- I think we made a lot of (inaudible) over the year. The food category you asked about is one of the pluses on my list. When I say that, we've achieved operating efficiencies. We've (inaudible) manufacturing capabilities, we've overcome the loss of some of the wholesale business that occurred there. The direct to consumer retail business. We've -- so that business is running well and getting better all the time. Our franchising initiative that we just introduced in Fannie May will help us to grow that business in a capital efficient way going forward. So as we look over the course of the year, the biggest impact in the food category is in the second fiscal quarter or the fourth calendar quarter, which is the holiday quarter. So we feel good about where we're positioned this holiday period, especially with consumer-- and we feel, frankly, that the decisions we've made over the last several years to emphasize that part of our merchandising mix and our flower and gift shops, that emphasizes the gourmet food and gift product category in our shop and in our brands has held us up well. And the fact that we think we can grow those businesses even in this tough time and create a capital efficient kind of ways without being risk associated with them says decisions we've made over the last few years were good ones. So we think our business is good, stable, and doing well even in a tough time. It's gaining market share. They are increasing opportunities for us there. It makes good use of our customer relationships. Makes good use of the flexible balance sheet we have. And we feel that we're really well positioned to grow in a prudent and safe kind of way, existing brands, the new brands that we birthed in that category in the last-- Couple of other specific things, too, that we're happy with in the food business. We recently rebranded Cheryl and Company to be Cheryl, representing our focus and one of the great growth areas we've had in Cheryl's is putting a focus not just on cookies but now into brownies. Trying to stakeout a leadership in the brownie gifting sector and that's growing nicely. And the Cheryl's branding is being well received by our customer base. And it's early to say, but one of the things that we've done in Cheryl's is we have a few retail stores associated with our Cheryl's brand and our management team that we charged with coming up with the concept to make those stores even more attractive and more successful so that we could have a decision as to whether or not we roll them out either in a franchise model or some other way. We relaunched our flagship store, which is in the Easton Town Center and it only reopened about five weeks ago. And frankly, those first five or six weeks now maybe, six weeks ago, the results are terrific. Too early to say, but it's an example of the spade work we're doing to build future opportunities to explore our growth initiatives. We think we're going to have good success and we know we have good success in growing the Fannie May retail side of the business. We think it would be very successful to grow in a franchise model but I want you to know that we have other -- pardon the pun, things in the oven in terms of other growth opportunities in the gift food brands. And we now have two of those businesses on our (inaudible) platform, getting -- really enabling them now to grow their eCommerce business, which (inaudible) The third party marketing program. I'll ask Bill to give you the negatives on that. But as you saw in this quarter we had a beneficial impact from canceling the Martha program which was a marketing program. That had a positive contribution. That was offset by the negative contribution which I'll ask Bill to quantify from our third party marketing, and that will anniversary in this next quarter. We'll finish that in the fourth calendar quarter, our second fiscal, and it'll be gone then. Bill? Good morning, everyone. As you know, our fiscal third quarter is dominated by consumer flower business which represents the majority of our revenue and contribution margin for the period due primarily to the Valentine's Day holiday. During the quarter we saw a number of positive trends that I will discuss in a moment. However, our overall financial results for the period were impacted by the unsatisfactorily performance of the promotional programs that we deployed to offset the anticipated effects of the Valentine's Day Sunday day placement. As we head into this year's Valentine's Day holiday we made a decision to step up our marketing spending and provide consumers with a free shipping or a no service charge promotion to incent early ordering for early delivery. On a positive note we saw an increase in order volume for the holiday period. This is a continuation of the improving trend that we have seen in our consumer floral category since the 20% decline in last year's Valentine period. We also achieved an increase in the number of customers we attracted which were up approximately 6% for the quarter. However, the listed orders for the holiday was insufficient to offset the impact of our gross margin average order value related to these promotions. This combined with the increase in advertising spending to drive the promotion resulted in significantly lower category contribution which impacted overall EBITDA and EPS for the quarter. It is important to note that this promotional program was a one-time effort directly related to this year's day placement of Valentine's Day and not something we will repeat going forward. With that said, we drive a number of very key learnings from the program which I'll ask Chris to describe in more detail in his remarks later on in this call. As I mentioned earlier, this year's Valentine's holiday we have seen an improving trend in our consumer floral business in terms of revenue and gross margin. With the exception of the recent Valentine's Day we are seeing a continuation of these trend as well as some signs of gradual improvement in the overall consumer discretionary spending. We believe these trends bode well for our current quarter and for improvement in the consumer floral category results of fiscal 2011. It is also worth noting we have seen a significant boost in brand awareness and consumer engagement since our recent appearance on the CBS hit television show ""Undercover Boss"" which attracted more than 15 million viewers on its first airing. This was a tremendous experience for our company that put a much deserved spotlight on some of the great people working in our organization as well as the wonderfully talented and passionate florists in our franchise flower shops around the country. This show also helped illustrate the unique family florist heritage of the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM brand and the importance of our efforts to engage with our customers and develop a relationship as their florist. Based on the great response we have had from our customers, we view this as a great branding event that we plan to leverage in our marketing and merchandising programs going forward. I will ask the star of the show, my brother Chris, to provide some highlights from his experience in a few minutes. Before I turn the call over to Bill for his review of the metrics for the quarter I'd like to expand a little bit on some of the positive developments we are seeing in our business. Our Bloomnet wire service continues to set itself apart as a leading innovator and best value proposition in the wired service industry. During the fiscal third quarter Bloomnet grew its revenues and maintained a strong 30% contribution margin despite the difficult Valentine holiday. In our gourmet food and gift baskets category, during the third quarter we produced strong top and bottom-line results with revenue up almost 14% and contribution margin up approximately 12%. This reflects solid double-digit growth in our online chance including our new 1-800-BASKETS.COM brand. Our continued strong performance in this category illustrates the benefits of our investments over the past several years in our gourmet food and gift basket businesses which are proving to be an excellent platform for future growth and a perfect complement for our merchandising mix in our flower and gift shops. Importantly we see a positive trend in all our gourmet food gift trend as our customers are increasingly drawn to the great quality and selection of the Popcorn Factory, Cheryl's cookies and brownies, Fanny Mae chocolates, winetasting.com, (inaudible) and of course, 1-800-BASKETS.COM. Regarding our new gift basket business, since its launch back in November 1-800-BASKETS.COM has achieved consistent growth as more and more of our customers are attracted to the beautifully designed and confected gift (inaudible), baskets, and gourmet collections. Importantly the 1-800-BASKETS brand is growing without a significant incremental marketing spend because we're leveraging the strong brand equity and the site traffic of 35 million strong customers in our database of 1-800-FLOWERS.COM. I now turn the call over to Bill so he can take us through the metrics for the quarter. This is Jim. Eric, I think you can see that while there is some relationship between the amount of business that 1-800-Flowers generates and BloomNet, I think what you've seen is our efforts over the last couple of years have not made them totally parallel. What I mean by that is, what the 1-800-Flowers management team that Chris now directly leads with a very much flattened organization is knitting itself much closer together with BloomNet so that the things we do in the Flowers brand can specifically benefit BloomNet. But independent of those activities, you have the programs that BloomNet's been introducing over the last couple of years, and the product category, where we've developed this terrific relationship with Yankee Candle benefiting all of our BloomNet floral partners, where we've introduced the Lotsa Love - Plush program, again, products that 1-800-Flowers will be featuring that our florists can now carry on a very good cost basis, and delivering good value to our customers helping them to deliver smiles in unique and different ways. (Inaudible) program which we're just introducing now as another example in the product category of how BloomNet is growing independent of its relationship with Flowers yet growing more intertwined with it every day. In addition, services, the digital directory, the website hosting, the educational and training programs, the marketing programs, we just had a big introduction of our new floral university training center that we physically opened in our Jacksonville facility just a couple of days ago, that's called the Floriology Institute, wonderfully received by scores of florists who attended it, attended the first wedding training program there, other florists who came to view the center, participate. The people from the Arrondi industry applaud it in terms of how even in a tough time we're investing our relationship with our BloomNet florists in training, in marketing, in promotion and in finding the right products like our new glass collection to help them compete, to help them serve our customers and to help them to better integrate the offerings they have so that 1-800-Flowers, as they step on the gas pedal, has its engine behind it for fulfillment, all embracing our floristness. So I think there's a relationship but no longer a direct correlation which has been evidenced by the performance you've seen over the last few quarters. Well, I think you have to look historically first to get the best indication. And what you're seeing there is over the last two years, and I'll answer this because Bill is suffering terribly from a cold. He would like to, but he's suffering. What we have done with our free cash flow is, we said -- we used to say we had three uses for cash flow return it to our shareholders, make strategic investments, or improve our balance sheet and pay down debt. Frankly in, this environment, we're not looking to return it our shareholders, we're looking to maintain our flexibility, increase our flexibility. This year we paid down $32 million in term debt and over the last two years, it's over $60 million that we've paid down on debt . So the evidence historically is, as we are fortunate enough to generate excess free cash flow, we're using that to strengthen our balance sheet. Going forward, we'll continue to strengthen our balance sheet. We'll continue to be prudent in the use of that cash we generate and hopefully increase our cash generation overtime from operating side of the business and use that to grow our business, either by improving the flexibility in our balance sheet or perhaps there's something we find that would be a perfect fit with one of our platforms that we already have in place that offer us a broader product assortment and leverage in whatever new activities we get All right, we'll treat that as a three-parter. Bill, will you take the first part for Ingrid? Sure. As we look at the consumer floral business and we look at what's taken place in the competitive landscape, it's become a very promotional category. Therefore, we are making sure we're continuing to build -- deepen our relationships with our customers and with are renewed focus on our product development, really organization embracing our flowers and working with our BloomNet florists to bring product and value to the consumer, and value, by value, I do not necessarily mean cheap price. I mean, good value for your money, good creative designs. We will be able to shift and be less reliant on discounts promotional, discount -- we'll always go into work with good promotional partners to extend our reach and extend our brand. Things we're doing currently is an example of that and other companies that we'll look to work with on a promotional basis going forward. Well, I think we're doing a couple of things, Eric. This is Jim. One is 1-800-BASKETS is a business that we're growing on the back of the brand relationship we have with 1-800-FLOWERS.COM. We have 35 million customer database there. We're exposing those customers to the 1-800-BASKETS brand we're doing it in a way that is efficient from a marketing spend so we don't have to a big third-party send on marketing to grow their brand, to grow it to be quite an integration of other products as you can see in the mix that we have now we're both integrating the other brand products and expanding the brand product categories that we're in by introducing other third-party products, gives us a great environment to test without a lot of capital behind these programs. So I think you'll continue to see good steady solid integration, good steady aggressive growth as a result of our ability to market to the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM customers, and the exploration and development of our opportunities in the product category with the experimentations that are going on. Indeed, Jeff, and thanks for the question. What you say is exactly the case that we see as well. There is a lot of challenges and that's why we're seeing very, very reserved in our expectations and our -- what we're speaking about in terms of what successes we expect here. But let's look at the facts as we have them. Our chocolate business has held up very well during these past tough couple of years. The store economics for Fannie May are really good, really sound. We've had great success in all of the stores we've opened up and all of the concepts that we've introduced in Fannie May, including broadening in a product line to include really good quality Fannie May dessert business and our ice cream business in particular, which carries our business through the summertime. So the business is good. It's, it's a growing business. The eCommerce business is growing particularly well. The stores help that go. And, yes, it's a difficult environment for people to get financing. But what we're finding in our early discussions, Jeff, is that there's lots of interest, lots of people getting pushed out of corporate America, lot of them have buyout packages. Lot of them are realizing, hey, I have to provide for myself. There's not going to be any magical retirement program. I need to control my own destiny and that's usually when franchise businesses usually are (inaudible) grow, they pick up momentum during tough times because of that displacement of individuals. We're probably not focused on a lot of mom and pop people, those people during the early stages. We've been having discussions with very well financed, experienced operators who would like to do a market in the areas that we would like to build our market in the areas that we want to go to, where we have great evidence of success in. So we have been counter cyclical, we're doing well historically, the potential franchisees come with financing in place and with a good track record in a variety of different concepts. So we think we're taking a prudent path here and why we think we're going to be particularly successful. One of the learnings we saw from Valentine's Day with the free ship offer was the two weeks out, the two weeks leading up to Valentine's Day we saw strong revenue growth. It was as we got closer to the holiday that it did not work. So we're taking some of those learnings and implementing those promotional campaigns where they make sense. And in terms of design pack, I'll give you a couple of points there, Ingrid. One is, you remember the reason why we purchased that business, was to use it as a kernel of our capabilities to build out our 1-800-Baskets and gift set business. That was our primary motivation. Clearly, what we said was that the wholesale business wasn't something we were looking to grow, but I will tell you, we were not looking for it to decline the way it did. I think there were two reasons why it declined. We're disappointed in the decline. The decline had, I would say, two reasons. One is management failure to broaden the customer base. We've made management changes there. We've made pricing changes there. And we think we can improve that business. It will take a couple of selling cycles to fully recover. So it's disappointing, but the business we bought and the capability we got from 1-800- Baskets are what we hoped for. What we've done, too, we've retooled the size of that business so that it can be profitable at a lower level and still have all the support infrastructure and the platform for us to build 1-800-Baskets. We launched 1-800-Baskets to the consumer November 1. It's been a good launch. Clearly we made some mistakes in that process, but mistakes, if I could characterize them as good mistakes. We sold out too quickly, we were too promotional when we didn't need to be. We'll learn from those lessons and we're very happy with the way the 1-800-Baskets piece of that will go. So while we didn't buy the business to grow the wholesale business, we're disappointed in its decline. We think we have things in place to remedy that. It will take a couple of cycles to sell through, but the other reason why it declined is some of our biggest customers just pulled back dramatically in the gift basket, gift set category, fearing the consumer demand going more towards staples and less towards gifting product. We are starting to see a little recovery in that. I think it's mostly where we're seeing the improvement is when we share data with those customers of where the gift basket products sell so well for us beyond Christmas at Valentine's Day, Father's Day, spring holidays, we are starting to see an uptick in interest in carrying those products throughout a broader set of gifting seasons, and that we think speaks well for the future of that business. In terms of ""Undercover Boss"", there are a number of things. One, I think Chris did a fantastic job on the call. And I might point out there that since that time, David, so I said two things happened, some of our customers, we only had a few customers on wholesale side. Some of those customers just went out of the category. Others we lost market share in. We lost market share to a couple of competitors who, by the way, some of whom are really struggling, a couple have filed for bankruptcy. We wouldn't sell our product at a loss. Some of our competitors, I think, unknowingly did. And I think that will right itself in the next couple of years now as the market is rationalized because you can't sell product at a loss. We're quite pleased with how Bloomnet is doing, Anthony. We saw good performance again this quarter, good margins. I think we are really very confident about where Bloomnet can go in the future. One of the outgrowths of the experience that we had with ""Undercover Boss"" was a dramatic outpouring of sentiment from not only Bloomnet networks but in particular Bloomnet, our franchisees, and florists around the country, in fact around North America, saying how pleased they were with our involvement in the program, how they thought it reflected them in such a very good light, and that they were pleased with the emphasis that was placed on our retail florist component, the fact that we're a multi channel company and that we celebrated our retail flower shops. So there's been tremendous outpouring from Bloomnet in that regard. I think that's something we can build on. I think they were pleased and we're getting great reaction to the continuing suite of services that we're rolling out, the product opportunities. We have a program that's been particularly well embraced where we introduce our whole glass container buying program which reduces their costs, gives them the opportunity to improve their margins, service their customers better, and so both from a service and product category I think we're more enthusiastic than ever in terms of how we can deepen our relationship with our existing customer base in bloom net. Yes. I think we learned that our spot them on program is successful. Any way that we reach out and engage our customers in a creative kind of way, whether there's a purchase or not, helps us to build our brand, extend our customer reach, and develop our potential future customers down the road. So I would say that the dramatic approach you've seen us use for each of our holiday periods and (inaudible) are examples of the promotional efforts you'll see, not necessarily price promotion, but engagement opportunities with our customers. Okay. I'll handle that. Chris, would you start with -- start at the end -- start with the last quarter. Separate from that is what he's asking. Thank you, Melena, and thank you all for your questions and your interest. We'd be happy to have any further dialog that you'd like. You know how to contact us. And as Chris already mentioned we really have a really great Halloween gift lineup. As a flower shop Halloween was never a big and important holiday for us. But over the last four or five years that we've expanded the merchandising mix in our shop to accommodate our customers, to help them with their gifting-connected needs, to help them put smiles on the faces of the important people in their lives, with our Fannie May chocolates, our Cheryl's product, our popcorn factory product. I think we have a great mix. I invite you to come to the site, the 1-800-Flowers site, see the 1-800-Baskets collection. And I think you should do your research and sample those products and put the smiles on the faces of your friends, your family, your loved ones. So until next time or until we chat, thanks so much for your interest today. Good morning, how are you doing?"
